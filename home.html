							World-X Studio is here to inspire. Here we will be offering many resources meant to get you excited about the world of Python. Python is a very easy to learn, powerful and popular
							programming language. In fact in 2017 it was deemed the most popular programming language in the world by the IEEE Spectrum*, and that still remains true today. You absolutely can
							learn to be a creator, if you can use a mouse and keyboard then you're all set to get started learning Python. 
						</p>

							We are currently working away to bring World-X Studio to life. If you are interested in joining the crew feel free to e-mail me at 
							<a href="mailto:zvisger@worldxstudio.com">zvisger@worldxstudio.com</a>.
							At the moment I'm the sole contributor but I'd like to put a team together so don't fret to let me know. Please be patient as we construct World-X, and thanks for checking us out!
