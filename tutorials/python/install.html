				<h3 id="page-subtitle"> ~ Installing Python 3 through Pyzo ~ </h3>
				<p>
					To be specific this tutorial series focuses on version 3 of Python. Whichever sub-version is the newest should be the one you install but anything below Python 3 will not be entirely
					compatible with the code in these tutorials.
				</p>
				<p>
					I will mostly be focused on the Python code itself as it will run the same on any IDE or Integrated Development Environment, or whichever method you decide to use for coding in Python. Though for beginners I
					recommend using an IDE named <a href="https://pyzo.org/" id="normal-link-red" target="_blank">Pyzo</a> as it's compatible with Windows, Linux and MacOS, and has many useful features. I've chosen Pyzo as 
					it will allow me to explain IDE specific steps for beginners which will be the same despite which OS you are using. Although most other IDEs will have very similar steps and shouldn't be too hard to follow
					along with.
				</p>
				<p>
					The steps for installing Pyzo are available at the "Getting started with Pyzo" link below. It will guide you through installing the Pyzo IDE, of course, and also through the process of setting it all 
					up with a Python interpereter. When you get to step 2 you're welcome to install any of the 3 options (regular Python, Anaconda, or Miniconda) and the code in these tutorials will
					work just fine, but for now you only really need "regular Python". Anaconda and Miniconda come with additional scientific packages for doing more advanced things with Python, but we will go over how to
					install packages ourselves later when we need them but the link below shows how to do that as well.

				</p>

					I will go over this process more in a seperate tutorial series about getting to know Pyzo. I may also go over other IDEs at another time to expand the information available to you from World-X Studio.

				<p>
					You are completely welcome to use whichever IDE you prefer. An IDE is basically just a fancy text editing program meant for writing code. They have many features which enhance the process of coding, but if 
					you prefer to simply use a basic text editor like "Notepad" for windows or "Text Editor" in linux that is also an option. The following link can be followed to learn more about these various other ways of
					installing and coding in Python 3.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you would like to install Python outside of an IDE, for use through the command prompt/terminal or some other way than Pyzo not listed here, then you can follow the link below to read how to do that in Windows, Linux
					and MacOS. There are even steps for using Python on Android or iOS!
