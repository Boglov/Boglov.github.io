				<h3 id="page-subtitle"> ~ Installing Python 3 through Pyzo ~ </h3>
				<p>
					To be specific this tutorial series focuses on the version of Python called Python 3. Whichever sub-version is the newest should be the one you install but anything below Python 3 will likely not be entirely
					compatible with the code in these tutorials.
				</p>
				<p>
					I will mostly be focused on the Python code itself as it will run the same throughout all editors, or IDEs. Though for beginners I recommend using an IDE named <a href="https://pyzo.org/" id="normal-link-red" target="_blank">Pyzo</a> as it's compatible with Windows, Linux and
					MacOS, and has many useful features. I've chosen Pyzo as it will allow me to explain IDE specific steps for beginners which will be the same despite which OS you are using. Although most other IDEs will have
					very similar steps and shouldn't be too hard to follow along with.
				</p>
				<p>
					The steps for installing Pyzo are available at the "Getting started with Pyzo" link below. It will guide you through installing the Pyzo IDE, of course, and also through the process of setting it all 
					up with a Python interpereter.

				<h3 id="page-subtitle"> ~ Installing Python 3 - Other methods ~ </h3>
				<p>
					You are completely welcome to use whichever IDE you prefer. An IDE is basically just a fancy text editing program meant for writing code. They have many features which enhance the process of coding, but if 
					you prefer to simply use a basic text editor like "Notepad" for windows or "Text Editor" in linux that is also an option. The following link can be followed to learn more about these various other ways of
					installing and coding in Python 3.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you would like to install Python outside of an IDE, for use through the command prompt/terminal or some other way than Pyzo not listed here, then you can follow the link below to read how to do that in Windows, Linux
					and MacOS. There are even steps for using Python on Android or iOS!
