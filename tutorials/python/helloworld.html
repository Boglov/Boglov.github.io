				<p>
					Once you're all set, go ahead and open Pyzo, or any Python IDE of your chosing, and make a new file named "helloworld.py". Now go ahead and type in the code above then run it. If you've only just begun
					learning Python then congratulations, you've written and interpereted your first program!
					
				</p>
				<p>
					This is often the very first program anyone writes. This one line of code above, when ran through the Python interpereter, will simply output the text "Hello, World!" to your Python console.
					It's easy enough to explain. 
				<p>
					The function "print()" takes whatever you put between the () and prints it to the screen, or more specifically the Python console. For this example we put the phrase
					"Hello, World!" into the print funciton and it prints out that phrase. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Another way to use print() would be to store our phrase into some variable, and we can give that variable the name my_phrase. After it is stored we can then type print(my_phrase) to get the same output
					as before. Notice that there are no quotation marks around the variable name. To do this we would type in the code below:
				</p>
					<div class="centered">
						<code>
							my_phrase = "Hello, World!" <br>
							print(my_phrase)
						</code>
					</div>
				<p>
					Again the output would be "Hello, World!", but this time you've learned how to create your first variable - my_phrase - and how to print it's contents out to the screen. This tutorial is simply to get you
					started running code as soon as possible, introduce you to the very useful print function, and how to store data ("Hello, World") into a variable (my_phrase).
				</p>
				<p>
					In the next tutorial we will go into more detail about variables and the many different forms of data which can be stored inside them.
