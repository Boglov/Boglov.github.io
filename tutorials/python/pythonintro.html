						<h3 id="page-subtitle"> ~ About Python ~ </h3>
						<p>
							Python is an incredibly easy to use programming language. It's
							designed to resemble natural spoken language rather than the usual
							more machine-oriented programming languages like C++ and Java.
							That makes it easier to read and understand, and also makes
							it very easy to learn.
						</p>
						<p>
							While Python is very simple, it happens to also be incredibly
							powerful and makes the process of getting your ideas up
							and running quicker than most others.
						</p>

						<h3 id="page-subtitle"> ~ It's Free! ~ </h3>
						<p>
							Not only is Python free to use, it's also free in the
							sense that it's open-source. Open-source means that
							you, or any coders, are welcome to alter the very
							structure and functionality of it. While it's not
							necessary to do that, it can be very useful.
						</p>
						
						<h3 id="page-subtitle"> ~ It's object-oriented ~ </h3>
						<p>
							If you aren't familiar with other programming languages
							you may not have heard of the phrase "object-oriented".
							However it's a simple concept which most programming
							languages are designed around, and it's pretty self
							explanatory, but here's the scoop.
						</p>

						<p>
							The idea object-oriented programming languages revolve
							around is, well, objects! Just like real world objects
							these virtual objects have qualities which define them.
							Say you're making a text based game, where you have a
							player 'object'. This player object would have some
							data that defines it. Like a name perhaps, and if it's
							an adventure game maybe the player should have some stats.
							Let's say stamina, and health. An example for the layout
							of this player object could look like this:
						</p>

						Player: <br>
						<ul>
							<li>has a name <br></li>
							<li>has an amount of health <br></li>
							<li>has a stamina stat <br></li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							This is a very basic example, and objects can be used
							in many ways. This player object would likely be an
							object that only gets instantiated, or 'spawned', once.
							Some objects may instead be meant to represent the
							structure of many instances of that object. For this
							text adventure themed example, you
							might have an object defining what attributes each
							item you put into your game would have. This item
							object may have a name and an id to represent what
							kind of item it is, and the layout for that might look
							something like this:
						</p>

						Item: <br>
						<ul>
							<li>has a name <br></li>
							<li>has a type id<br></li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							This Item object could then be created and used over
							and over as a template for every item you put into
							your game. Each of those items would then be able
							to have their own name and type that can be retrieved
							for use later in your game. Like when listing the
							items that the player has in their inventory or any
							other case you find to need it. A couple examples might
							look like this,
						</p>

						Item: Steel Sword<br>
						<ul>
							<li>has a name: "Steel Sword" <br></li>
							<li>has a type id: "Weapon"<br></li>
						</ul>

						Item: Health Potion<br>
						<ul>
							<li>has a name: "Health Potion" <br></li>
							<li>has a type id: "Potion"<br></li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							Now again this is a simplified way of explaining it,
							but I think it gets the idea across without getting
							too technical, it's necessary to mention that these
						    objects can, and should, also have some 'ways' to do things.
							With that said we can extend the Player object layout
						    above to something more like:
						</p>
						<p>
							Player: <br>
							<ul>
								<li>has a name <br></li>
								<li>has an amount of health <br></li>
								<li>has a stamina stat <br></li>
								<li>has a 'way' to change it's name <br></li>
							<li>has a 'way' to adjust it's stamina stat <br></li>
							<li>has a 'way' to adjust it's health <br></li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							Of course these layouts above aren't written in actual
							code, but instead what we call pseudocode. Pseudocode
							is just a fancy word for describing the steps that
							code takes to accomplish a task. It can make it easier
							to plan and share what your code is doing in a more
							comprehensive way than writing it all out in code just
							to get an idea across.
						</p>
						<p>
							Here we really won't go much more into detail about
							these things as this is only meant to be an introduction.
							Though later in the tutorials we will go over all of
							this in more detail.
