				Intro to Python
			</h2>			
			
			<h3 id="page-subtitle"> A little about Python </h3>
			<p>
				Python is an easy to use programming language. It's
				designed to resemble natural spoken language rather than the usual,
				more machine-oriented, programming languages like C++ and Java.
				That makes it easier to read and understand, and also makes
				it very easy to learn.
			</p>

			<p>
				While Python is pretty simple, it happens to also be incredibly
				powerful and makes the process of getting your ideas up
				and running quicker than most others.
			</p>

			<p>
				Some notable features of Python:

			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>It's elegant, easy to read and write.<br></li>
				<li>It has a large amount of pre-written, open-source packages. So you don't have to "reinvent the wheel".<br></li>
				<li>It's expandable and open-source, allowing you to alter the very language itself to suit your needs.<br></li>
				<li>It's free!<br></li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="page-subtitle"> It's free </h3>
			<p>
				Not only is Python free to use, it's also free in the
				sense that it's open-source. Open-source means that
				you, or any anyone, are welcome to change the 
				structure and functionality of it's source code . 
				While it's not necessary to do that, it can be very useful.
			</p>

			<h3 id="page-subtitle"> It's popular </h3>
			<p>
				Python is actually an unbelievably popular language
				all around the world. Many jobs are available to those
				who gain an understanding of it and really get to know 
				how to use it. Actually it happens to be the #1 most
				popular programming language in the world, and 
				that's probably not going to change any time soon.
			</p>

			<h3 id="page-subtitle"> Has a great community  </h3>
			<p>
				If you've ever tried learning something, I'm sure you realized
				that it helps a lot to be able to talk with someone who has  experience
				about whatever it is you're learning. Python is no different, and
				fortunately, due to it's popularity, there are many online communities
				for it. Meant to be places where we can
				connect, share, ask questions and help other people. World-X
				Studio intends to further expand that community and bring 
				excitement to those creative people looking for an outlet for
				their ideas.
			</p>

			<p>

				Currently the World-X Forum is still in the works, but surely
				we will deliver so keep an eye on the site to see what's to come!
			</p>

			<h3 id="page-subtitle">  It's object-oriented </h3>
			<p>
				If you aren't familiar with other programming languages
				you may not have heard of the phrase "object-oriented".
				However it's a simple concept which most programming
				languages are designed around, and it's pretty self
				explanatory, but here's the scoop.
			</p>

			<p>
				The idea that object-oriented programming languages revolve
				around is, well, objects! Just like real world objects
				these virtual objects have qualities which define them.
				Say you're making a text based game, where you have a
				player 'object'. This player object would have some
				data that defines it. Like a name perhaps, and if it's
				an adventure game maybe the player should have some stats.
				Let's say stamina, and health. An example for the layout
				of this player object could look like this:
			</p>

			Player: <br>
			<ul>
				<li>has a name <br></li>
				<li>has an amount of health <br></li>
				<li>has a stamina stat <br></li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				This is a very basic example, and objects can be used
				in many ways. This player object would likely be an
				object that only gets instantiated, or 'spawned', once.
				Some objects may instead be used as a template for
				many objects in your game.For this text adventure themed 
				example, you
				might have an object defining what attributes each
				item you put into your game would have. This item
				object may have a name and an id to represent what
				kind of item it is, and the layout for that might look
				something like this:
			</p>

			Item: <br>
			<ul>
				<li>has a name <br></li>
				<li>has a type id<br></li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				This Item object could then be created and used over
				and over as a template for every item you put into
				your game. Each of those items would then be able
				to have their own name and type that can be retrieved
				for use later in your game. Like when listing the
				items that the player has in their inventory or any
				other case you find to need it. A couple examples might
				look like this,
			</p>

			Item: Steel Sword<br>
			<ul>
				<li>has a name: "Steel Sword" <br></li>
				<li>has a type id: "Weapon"<br></li>
			</ul>

			Item: Health Potion<br>
			<ul>
				<li>has a name: "Health Potion" <br></li>
				<li>has a type id: "Potion"<br></li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Now again this is a simplified way of explaining it,
				but I think it gets the idea across without getting
				too technical, it's necessary to mention that these
				objects can, and should, also have some 'ways' to do things.
				With that said we might then extend the Player object layout
				above to something more like:
			</p>
			
			Player: <br>
			<ul>
				<li>has a name <br></li>
				<li>has an amount of health <br></li>
				<li>has a stamina stat <br></li>
				<li>has a 'way' to change it's name <br></li>
				<li>has a 'way' to adjust it's stamina stat <br></li>
				<li>has a 'way' to adjust it's health <br></li>
			</ul>
		
			<p>
				Of course these layouts above aren't written in actual
				code, but instead what we call pseudocode. Pseudocode
				is just a fancy word for describing the steps that
				code takes to accomplish a task. It can make it easier
				to plan and share what your code is doing in a more
				comprehensive way than writing it all out in code just
				to get an idea across. I've put 'way' in quotations to
				express that it stands for a Function in Python but we 
				will go over those later in detail.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of these object templates in Python would be 
				referred to as a class. So when we talk about classes,
				we are referring to object templates essentially.
				Here we really won't go much more into detail about
				these things as this is only meant to be an introduction.
			</p>

			<h3 id="page-subtitle">Most importantly, it's fun!</h3>
			<p>
				From my experience, Python is a wonderful thing.
				I'm not just saying that though, once I learned Python I really
				gained a lot of interest and confidence in writing code. It's why
				I'm here today, building World-X Studio. 
			</p>
			<p>
				My hope is of sparking that confidence and joy within you, and to inspire you about getting
				in touch with your creative side. Wether you're a complete beginner or a seasoned
				programmer looking to learn Python, let's get you started!
