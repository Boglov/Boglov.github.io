				<h3 id="page-subtitle"> ~ Commenting your code ~ </h3>
				
				<p>
					In case you're not familiar with the concept of variables, they are simply containers which can hold your data so you
					can use it later in your code. To create a variable you just have to come up with a name for it which describes what
					it will be storing, and set it equal to the value/data you wish to store inside it. For example:
				</p>
				
				<div class="centered">
					<code class="code-base">
						# variable_name = data to store <br>
						favorite_candy = "chocolate bars"
					</code>
				</div>

				<p>
					The first line in the code above is what's called a comment. A comment is just meant to clarify what your code is doing
					and while it isn't necessary to comment your code, it is very wise. Commenting your code makes it easier, for you or 
					anyone else who reads your code, to understand what that code is doing. In Python a comment is begun with a pound symbol,
					#, and for better readability you should follow the pound by one space before typing in your comment as I've done above.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Keep in mind that comments actually have no effect on the functionality of your code and is actually ignored by the Python
					interpereter when you run it. Only the line with the pound sign will be commented, any following lines of code
					will be executed as usual. There are a couple different ways to comment your code, including ways to make multi-line comments
					without using a pound sign at the start of each one, but for now we will stick to the basics.

				<h3 id="page-subtitle"> ~ Storing your data in variables ~ </h3>

				<p>
					In the last tutorial we learned how to store a line of text in a variable we named my_phrase. Text is not the only
					thing you can store in variables though, variables can hold all sorts of data which can then be used later when it is
					needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some data types which variables can hold include integers, strings, and booleans. It's very easy to create variables
					to hold your data, and it's a key part of programming. Below are a few examples:

				</p>

				<div class="centered">
					<code class="code-base">
						# Storing an integer (whole number) <br>
						my_number = 28 <br>
						print("My integer:", my_number) <br>
						<br>
						# Storing a float (floating point number) <br>
						my_float = 3.75 <br>
						print("My float:", my_float) <br>
						<br>
						# Storing a boolean (either true or false) <br>
						my_bool = True <br>
						print("My bool:", my_bool) <br>
						<br>
						# Storing a string (text) <br>
						my_string = "Hello, World!" <br>
						print("My string:", my_string) <br>						
					</code>
					<br><b>Output:</b><br>
					<code class="code-output">
						My integer: 28 <br>
						My float: 3.75 <br>
						My bool: True <br>
						My string: Hello, World! <br>
					</code>
				</div>
					
				<p>
					Integers, floats, booleans and strings are the basic data types which can be stored in variables.
