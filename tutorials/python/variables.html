						In the last tutorial we learned how to store a line of text in a variable we named my_phrase. Text is not the only
						thing you can store in variables though, variables can hold all sorts of data which can then be used wherever it is
						needed. Some data types variables can hold include numbers, text, and tuples. It's very easy to create variables to
						hold your data, and it's a key part of programming. Below are a few examples of how to store your data in variables:

					<code>
						# Example from the previous tutorial <br>
						my_phrase = "Hello, World!" <br>
						print(my_phrase) <br>
						<br>
                                                <br>
						# Storing numbers <br>
						my_number = 28 <br>
						print(my_number) <br>
					</code>
