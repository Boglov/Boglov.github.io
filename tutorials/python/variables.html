				<h2 id="page-title"> Variables </h2>
				<p>
					In case you're not familiar with the concept of variables, they are simply containers which can hold your data so you
					can use it later in your code. To create a variable you just have to come up with a name for it which describes what
					it will be storing, and set it equal to the value/data you wish to store inside it. For example:
				</p>

favorite_candy <span style="color: #333333">=</span> <span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;chocolate bar&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
				<h3 id="page-smalltitle"> ~ Commenting your code ~ </h3>

				<p> 
					Before we get into variables any further I thought it would be important to introduce you to comments.
					The first line in the code above is what's called a comment. A comment is just a description meant to 
					clarify what your code is doing and while it isn't necessary to comment your code, it is very wise. 
					Comments are not specific to variables though, you can use them to describe any piece of code you'd like
					to touch on.
					
				</p>
				<p>
					Commenting your code makes it easier, for you or 
					anyone else who reads your code, to understand what that code is doing. In Python a comment is begun with a pound symbol,
					#, and for better readability you should follow the pound by one space before typing in your comment as I've done above.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Keep in mind that comments have no effect on the functionality of your code and are actually ignored by the Python
					interpereter when you run it. Only the line with the pound sign will be commented, any following lines of code
					will be executed as usual. There are a couple different ways to comment your code, including ways to make multi-line comments
					without using a pound sign at the start of each one, but for now we will stick to the basics.
				</p>
				
				<h3 id="page-smalltitle"> ~ Naming your variables ~ </h3>
				<p>
					One important thing about coding is how you format the names of your variables. Generally the most widely used format
					is to use either one lowercase letter, word, or words seperated with underscores. As we have done with the variable
					my_phrase in the "Hello, World!" tutorial. Other examples would be x, var or my_variable. 
					
				</p>
				
				<p>
					When you are deciding what to name variables it's ideal to come up with a name that describes what data it holds. For
					example, in a video game, you would probably name the players health variable "health". 
	
					You may also make a variable
					that stores how many gold pieces your player has.
				</p>
				<p>
					In that case it's probably better to name the variable gold_pieces
					rather than gp for the sake of being descriptive instead of trying to crunch it all down to the shortest possible name.
					So try to come up with a name with name that's not too long, but don't worry about all your variable names being super short.
				</p>
				
				<h3 id="page-subtitle"> ~ Basic data types ~ </h3>


				<p>
					In the last tutorial we learned how to store a line of text in a variable we named my_phrase. Text is not the only
					thing you can store in variables though, variables can hold all sorts of data which can then be used later when it is
					needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some data types which variables can hold include integers, floats, strings, and booleans. It's very easy to create variables
					to hold your data, and it's a key part of programming. Below are a few examples:

<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">print</span>(<span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;My integer:&quot;</span>, my_number)

<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">print</span>(<span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;My float:&quot;</span>, my_float)

<span style="color: #888888"># Storing a boolean (either true or false)</span>
my_bool <span style="color: #333333">=</span> <span style="color: #007020">True</span>
<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">print</span>(<span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;My bool:&quot;</span>, my_bool)

<span style="color: #888888"># Storing a string (text)</span>

<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">print</span>(<span style="background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;My string:&quot;</span>, my_string) 
</pre></div>

				<br><b>Output:</b><br>
				<code class="code-output">
					My integer: 28 <br>
					My float: 3.75 <br>
					My bool: True <br>
					My string: Hello, World! <br>
					>>
				</code>
					
				<p>
					You should go ahead and type in the code above if you haven't already, and then run it. The output should be the same as that shown above.
					That's how easy it is to create variables, but there are a few more types of data you might want to store. 
					
				</p>
				
				<h3 id="page-subtitle"> ~ More complex data types ~ </h3>

				<h3 id="page-smalltitle"> ~ Tuples ~ </h3>
				<p>
					Most other data types are just
					combinations of these basic ones shown above. An example of a more complex data type is what's called a tuple. Tuples consist of multiple
					pieces of data stored together seperated by commas. Like so:

				<h3 id="page-smalltitle"> ~ Lists ~ </h3>
				
				<p>
					Lists are another handy way to store multiple pieces of data, similar to tuples but lists are 
					usually better for holding many items.

					This is just an introduction to most of the types of data which come built into Python. You can use these basic data types to build more
					complex data types later on, which you'll create, called classes. But we will go into more detail in later tutorials.
