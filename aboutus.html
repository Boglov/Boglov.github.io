						<p>
							World-X Studio is a project I've dedicated myself to. It's meant to be a place where you can come and learn about all the wonders of programming. More importantly
							World-X Studio is here to inspire people to get in touch with their creative side, and to help you believe that you CAN be creator. Wether it's video games you
							want to create, or fancy software experiences, this is the place to be. Currently I am the only member of World-X Studio, but anyone interested in joining the
							crew is welcome to e-mail me at <a href="mailto:zvisger@worldxstudio.com">zvisger@worldxstudio.com</a>.
