					Hey thanks for checking out World-X Studio! I'm Zachery. A 28 year old, self taught, programmer. I've always had an interest in playing video games and when I was about 11 years old I 
					realized that, hey, video games don't
					just pop out of thin air. Someone has to be making all of this awesome stuff, and if they can then why can't I? So I set off on an adventure to learn what it takes to
					make video games. During that search I became a bit confused, how does all this strange text make up a game? Fortunately though I then came across a piece of software
					called GameMaker. GameMaker is a visual, "drag n' drop", type of game engine. That allowed me to start making games without being bogged down by all that crazy code stuff.
					
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I was so excited and motivated that I spent as much time as I could learning how it all worked. GameMaker has it's own programming language though, and that got me wondering.
					How hard is it really to code? How can I learn to write that crazy stuff? After a lot of web searching and learning how to do things as I came across them, I was able to
					figure it out. While web searching is, obviously, a huge benefit when you're learning to program, the inspiration I gained from interacting with online forums and other
					communities was equally powerful. 
					
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Since the GameMaker days, I've tried out a lot of different ways to make video games or whatever creations were floating around in my head. I used Unity3D for a long time,
					and it's a great free game engine for personal use. It's just that after some time I realized that what I loved about making games is really the part where you have a 
					complete understanding of something that you are building. Or in other words, the coding, and yes using C# with Unity is powerful and fun, but my curiousity got the best
					of me and off I went again to find a platform from which to put my creations together my way. 
					
				</p>
				<p>
					I used C++ for the most part after that, but one day I happened to stumble
					upon Python. I kept seeing it everywhere. Ironically, when I first heard of Python, I really didn't have any interest in it. I had
					mistakenly taken it for some gimmicky programming language that just happens to be trending. Boy was I wrong.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Now after spending about a year really buckling down with Python, and coming to love using it, I started wanting to share that sense of joy and accomplishment Python brought me. 
					So I started off on a mission to do just that. This is, in summary, the reason why I decided to build World-X Studio. I truly hope to help you bring out your creativity, and guide you
					on your way to accomplish your own coding dreams.
