				<h3 id="page-subtitle"> ~ About Me ~ </h3>
				<p>
					Hey thanks for checking out World-X Studio! I'm Zachery. A 28 year old, self taught, programmer from California. Since I was about 11 years old I've had a strong interest in computers and
					programming. Mostly making video games but I really enjoy programming all around. I've yet to make a career from it, but I've set out on this mission to share what knowledge I can from my
					experience. Hoping to bring excitement and confidence to others who also have an interest in programming.
