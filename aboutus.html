							We are currently working away to bring World-X Studio to life. If you are interested in joining the crew feel free to e-mail me at zvisger@worldxstudio.com. 
							At the moment I'm the sole contributor but I'd like to put a team together so don't fret. Please be patient as we construct World-X, and thanks for checking us out!
